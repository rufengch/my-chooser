# pokemon-chooser

### The Problem

When playing pokemon games, to fight effectively, I usually
1. look for the type(s) of the opponent pokemon
2. find a pokemon type chart to find types that are super effective to the opponent type
3. look through pokemons in my team for a super effective move

The goal of this package is to make this process easier.

### Usage

`fightAgainst(string)`

#### Arguments

string *(string)*: The name of the pokemon, or the name of the type

#### Returns

*(object)*: Returns an object containing super effective, effective, not very effective, and no effect types.
