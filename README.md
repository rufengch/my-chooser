### The Problem

When playing pokemon games, to fight effectively, I usually
1. look for the type of the opponent pokemon
2. go to a pokemon type chart to find types that are super effective to the opponent type
3. look through pokemons in my team for a super effective move

The goal of this package is to make this process easier.
